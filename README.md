# notebooks 0.0.1

## about

I believe that simple is better.

The idea behind this project is to build an investment strategy that will better help me (or you) invest in Bitcoin (or whatever asset).

The hope is that through every iteration, we'll find something that will improve our strategy. It's an incremental approach.

I've created a simple starting point in the 00_introduction notebook. Every now and again, I'll be adding a new notebook outlining some new hypotheses. Stay tuned!

I hope you enjoy going through these as much as I did making them!

Please send me some feedback if you have any!
