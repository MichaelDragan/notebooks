# notebooks 0.0.1

## About

Throughout these notebooks, we'll be exploring the different facets of quantitative analysis.

Often, I'll be making reference to the [mlfinlab](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) library, and my personal project [trader](https://github.com/MichaelDragan/trader) which we'll be using to interact with various exchanges.

My hope is that with every notebook published here, you'll discover something that can help you with your trading strategy.

If you're looking for a starting point, check this out: [00_introduction notebook](https://github.com/MichaelDragan/notebooks/blob/master/00_introduction.ipynb).

Every now and again, I'll be adding a new notebook testing out some new idea. Stay tuned!

Please send me some feedback or suggestions if you have any!
